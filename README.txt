On Windows:

    Download the windows executable version, and double-click
    'SinisterDucks.exe'.


On Mac or Linux:

    Install each of the dependancies listed below.

    Download the Sinister Ducks source tarfile, untar it.
    Then from a terminal, cd to the game directory and type:

        python -O SinisterDucks.py

    A configuration file, config.ini, can be used to affect the game,
    particularly useful to work around problems with sound. See comments
    within that file.


Dependencies

      Python 2.6:   May work with 2.7, but will not work with 3.x.
                    http://python.org/download/releases/2.6.2/
      pyglet 1.1.4: http://pyglet.org/download.html
      AVBin:        This is included with pyglet Windows (.msi) and Mac (.dmg)
                    binary installers, but if you installed pyglet from source
                    (.tar.gz or .zip, or easy_install) then you'll need to get
                    AVBin separately from here:
                    http://code.google.com/p/avbin/downloads/list


How to play the game

    Z to flap. Left and Right to steer.

    Attack the sinister ducks by colliding with them. Whichever bird is highest
    will win the fight - the loser will shed a feather and plummet from the
    sky.

    Collecting feathers boosts your multiplier.
    More points are awarded for consecutively hitting other birds without
    collecting any feathers.

    Use M to toggle the music.
